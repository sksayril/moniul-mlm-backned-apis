# Matrix Income Cycle System Documentation

## Overview
The Matrix Income System has been updated to work with **completed cycles** instead of individual user income. This means users only receive income when they complete full matrix cycles at each level.

## How It Works

### Matrix Structure
```
Level 1: 5 users required → ₹50 income per cycle
Level 2: 25 users required → ₹125 income per cycle  
Level 3: 125 users required → ₹625 income per cycle
Level 4: 625 users required → ₹1875 income per cycle
Level 5: 3125 users required → ₹6250 income per cycle
Level 6: 15625 users required → ₹15625 income per cycle
Level 7: 78125 users required → ₹78125 income per cycle
```

### Income Distribution Logic

#### Before (Old System)
- User gets ₹20 for each Level 1 member
- User gets ₹10 for each Level 2 member
- Income was distributed immediately when someone joined

#### After (New System)
- User gets ₹50 only when 5 Level 1 members complete
- User gets ₹125 only when 25 Level 2 members complete
- Income is distributed only on cycle completion

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Level 1 Progress
```
Members: 1, 2, 3, 4 → Income: ₹0 (cycle not complete)
Members: 5 → Income: ₹50 (1st cycle complete)
Members: 6, 7, 8, 9 → Income: ₹0 (2nd cycle in progress)
Members: 10 → Income: ₹50 (2nd cycle complete)
Total Income: ₹100 (2 completed cycles)
```

#### Scenario 2: Level 2 Progress
```
Members: 1-24 → Income: ₹0 (cycle not complete)
Members: 25 → Income: ₹125 (1st cycle complete)
Members: 26-49 → Income: ₹0 (2nd cycle in progress)
Members: 50 → Income: ₹125 (2nd cycle complete)
Total Income: ₹250 (2 completed cycles)
```

## API Changes

### New Endpoint: Matrix Income Status
```
GET /api/mlm/matrix/income-status
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "userInfo": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "userId": "LIFE10001",
      "isActive": true
    },
    "totalMatrixIncome": 175,
    "currentBalance": 1250,
    "matrixStatus": {
      "1": {
        "capacity": 5,
        "currentCount": 7,
        "completedCycles": 1,
        "earnedIncome": 50,
        "incomePerCycle": 50,
        "progressInCurrentCycle": 2,
        "neededForNextCycle": 3,
        "completionPercentage": "40.00"
      },
      "2": {
        "capacity": 25,
        "currentCount": 18,
        "completedCycles": 0,
        "earnedIncome": 0,
        "incomePerCycle": 125,
        "progressInCurrentCycle": 18,
        "neededForNextCycle": 7,
        "completionPercentage": "72.00"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Key Functions

#### 1. `calculateMatrixIncome(currentCount, level)`
```javascript
const calculateMatrixIncome = (currentCount, level) => {
  const matrixInfo = getMatrixInfo();
  const levelInfo = matrixInfo[level];
  
  if (!levelInfo) return 0;
  
  // Calculate how many complete cycles are achieved
  const completedCycles = Math.floor(currentCount / levelInfo.capacity);
  
  // Return income for completed cycles only
  return completedCycles * levelInfo.totalIncome;
};
```

#### 2. `getMatrixInfo()`
```javascript
const getMatrixInfo = () => {
  return {
    1: { capacity: 5, totalIncome: 50 },
    2: { capacity: 25, totalIncome: 125 },
    3: { capacity: 125, totalIncome: 625 },
    4: { capacity: 625, totalIncome: 1875 },
    5: { capacity: 3125, totalIncome: 6250 },
    6: { capacity: 15625, totalIncome: 15625 },
    7: { capacity: 78125, totalIncome: 78125 }
  };
};
```

### Income Distribution Flow

1. **User Joins Network**
   - New user added to upline's downline array
   - Current level count calculated
   - Check if new cycle completed
   - If cycle completed → distribute income
   - If cycle not completed → no income yet

2. **Income Transaction Record**
   ```javascript
   upline.incomeTransactions.push({
     type: 'matrix_income',
     amount: incomeToAdd,
     level: level,
     fromUser: userId,
     date: Date.now(),
     description: `Matrix Level ${level} cycle completed - ${currentLevelCount} users`
   });
   ```

3. **Recursive Processing**
   - Process continues up the referral chain
   - Each upline level checks for cycle completion
   - Income distributed independently at each level

## Benefits of New System

### 1. **Fair Income Distribution**
- No partial payments
- Clear cycle completion requirements
- Predictable income amounts

### 2. **Motivational Structure**
- Users work towards specific targets
- Clear progress tracking
- Milestone-based rewards

### 3. **System Stability**
- Prevents fractional income calculations
- Reduces transaction volume
- Cleaner audit trail

### 4. **Scalability**
- Handles large networks efficiently
- Sustainable income model
- Controlled growth pattern

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Track Cycle Progress
Use the new endpoint to monitor:
- Current progress in each level
- Completed cycles count
- Next cycle requirements
- Total earned income

### Income Transaction History
Each cycle completion creates a transaction record with:
- Type: `matrix_income`
- Amount: Full cycle income
- Level: Matrix level completed
- Description: Cycle completion details
- Timestamp: When cycle completed

## Migration Notes

### Existing Users
- Existing downline counts preserved
- Income recalculated based on completed cycles
- Historical transactions remain unchanged
- New system applies to future income only

### Data Integrity
- All matrix calculations use same base functions
- Consistent income amounts across system
- Audit trail maintained for all transactions
- Real-time progress tracking available
