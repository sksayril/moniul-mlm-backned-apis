# Matrix Income System Documentation

## Overview
The Matrix Income System rewards users based on the number of activated members in their downline across 7 levels. When specific member thresholds are reached, users receive substantial bonuses in their `matrixIncome` wallet.

## ‚úÖ **Updated Income Structure**

| Level | Members Required | Matrix Income | Total Potential |
|-------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1st   | 5               | ‚Çπ50          | ‚Çπ50             |
| 2nd   | 25              | ‚Çπ125         | ‚Çπ175            |
| 3rd   | 125             | ‚Çπ625         | ‚Çπ800            |
| 4th   | 625             | ‚Çπ1,875       | ‚Çπ2,675          |
| 5th   | 3,125           | ‚Çπ9,375       | ‚Çπ12,050         |
| 6th   | 15,625          | ‚Çπ46,875      | ‚Çπ58,925         |
| 7th   | 78,125          | ‚Çπ2,34,375    | ‚Çπ2,93,300       |

## üéØ **How It Works**

### Level Completion System
1. **User A** refers **User B**
2. When **User B** activates account with TPIN:
   - **User A** gets ‚Çπ50 direct income immediately
   - **User B** is added to **User A's** downline at Level 1
3. When **User A** reaches 5 activated members in Level 1:
   - **User A** receives ‚Çπ50 matrix income bonus
   - Total earnings: ‚Çπ50 (direct) + ‚Çπ50 (matrix) = ‚Çπ100

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Hold Until Complete System**
- ‚ùå **NO partial income**: 1 member = ‚Çπ0, 2 members = ‚Çπ0, 3 members = ‚Çπ0, 4 members = ‚Çπ0
- ‚úÖ **Full income only**: 5 members = ‚Çπ50 (complete bonus)
- üîí **One-time award**: Each level bonus can only be received once
- ‚è≥ **Wait system**: Income is held until exact threshold is reached

### Multi-Level Distribution
- Each activated user is added to upline users' downlines
- Matrix income is awarded only when exact member count is reached
- Income goes to `matrixIncome` wallet and updates `totalEarnings`

## üí∞ **Income Distribution Flow**

### When User Activates Account:
```
1. Self Income: ‚Çπ10 (activation bonus)
2. Daily Income: ‚Çπ10 (activation bonus)
3. Direct Referrer: ‚Çπ50 (direct income)
4. Matrix Income: Calculated across 7 levels
```

### Matrix Calculation Example:
```
User A ‚Üí User B ‚Üí User C ‚Üí User D (activates)

User D activation triggers:
- User C: +‚Çπ50 direct income
- User B: Matrix level check
- User A: Matrix level check
- Continue up to 7 levels
```

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### Database Updates:
```javascript
// When matrix level completed:
user.incomeWallet.matrixIncome += incomeAmount;
user.incomeWallet.balance += incomeAmount;
user.incomeWallet.totalEarnings += incomeAmount;

// Transaction record:
user.incomeTransactions.push({
  type: 'matrix_income',
  amount: incomeAmount,
  level: level,
  fromUser: activatedUserId,
  description: `Matrix Level ${level} completion bonus`
});
```

### Downline Tracking:
```javascript
user.downline.push({
  userId: newUserId,
  level: level,
  addedAt: Date.now()
});
```

## üìä **Matrix Progress Tracking**

### Real-time Monitoring:
- Track members at each level
- Calculate completion percentage
- Show next bonus threshold
- Display total potential earnings

### Console Logging:
```
Matrix Level 1: User LIFE10001 has 3/5 members
Matrix Level 1: User LIFE10001 needs 2 more members for ‚Çπ50 bonus
üéâ Matrix Level 1 COMPLETED for user LIFE10001! Awarding ‚Çπ50
‚úÖ ‚Çπ50 matrix income (Level 1) processed for user: LIFE10001
```

## üéÅ **Bonus Calculation Examples**

### Scenario 1: Small Team (5 members)
- **Direct Income**: 5 √ó ‚Çπ50 = ‚Çπ250
- **Matrix Level 1**: ‚Çπ50
- **Total**: ‚Çπ300

### Scenario 2: Medium Team (25 members)
- **Direct Income**: 25 √ó ‚Çπ50 = ‚Çπ1,250
- **Matrix Level 1**: ‚Çπ50
- **Matrix Level 2**: ‚Çπ125
- **Total**: ‚Çπ1,425

### Scenario 3: Large Team (125 members)
- **Direct Income**: 125 √ó ‚Çπ50 = ‚Çπ6,250
- **Matrix Level 1**: ‚Çπ50
- **Matrix Level 2**: ‚Çπ125
- **Matrix Level 3**: ‚Çπ625
- **Total**: ‚Çπ7,050

## üöÄ **Maximum Potential**

### Complete 7-Level Matrix:
- **Total Matrix Income**: ‚Çπ2,93,300
- **Direct Income**: 78,125 √ó ‚Çπ50 = ‚Çπ39,06,250
- **Daily Income**: 78,125 √ó ‚Çπ10 √ó 365 = ‚Çπ2,85,15,625/year
- **Grand Total Potential**: ‚Çπ3+ Crores annually

## üõ°Ô∏è **Validation Rules**

### Matrix Income Requirements:
- ‚úÖ User must be active
- ‚úÖ Exact member count must be reached
- ‚úÖ All members must be activated (not just registered)
- ‚úÖ Income awarded only once per level
- ‚úÖ Upline chain follows referral structure

### Error Handling:
- Skip inactive upline users
- Continue to next level if user missing
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Transaction history maintained

## üìà **API Integration**

### Matrix Status Check:
```javascript
GET /api/auth/me
// Returns matrix level progress
{
  "matrixStats": {
    "totalMatrixIncome": 175,
    "matrixLevels": [
      {
        "level": 1,
        "membersCount": 5,
        "requiredMembers": 5,
        "isCompleted": true,
        "rewardAmount": 50
      },
      {
        "level": 2,
        "membersCount": 25,
        "requiredMembers": 25,
        "isCompleted": true,
        "rewardAmount": 125
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## üéØ **Success Metrics**

### Team Building Incentives:
- **5 Members**: ‚Çπ50 bonus (achievable)
- **25 Members**: ‚Çπ125 bonus (moderate challenge)
- **125 Members**: ‚Çπ625 bonus (significant achievement)
- **625+ Members**: Life-changing income potential

### Progressive Rewards:
Each level requires exactly 5x more members than previous, but rewards increase exponentially, creating strong motivation for sustained team building.

**The Matrix Income System creates a powerful incentive structure that rewards both immediate referrals (‚Çπ50 direct income) and long-term team building (up to ‚Çπ2,34,375 per level completion).**
